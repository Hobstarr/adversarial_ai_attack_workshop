# Adversarial Workshop - DMU Cyberweek


What is Tensorflow? - 'an optimised machine 
learning platform for model creation and dataset management
with high computational speed and efficiency' 

How does gradient tape work?
Simple functions - that we know
Random functions - that we don't know

How can a normal model be tricked?
What is an adversarial example?
Visualisation of adversarial example(s)?

Can an attack made for one model
attack other models? What kind of efficiency

What kind of heuristics can we expect?
What is adversarial training?
What kind of performance can we receive?

Create a few random models - attack them
Create a model - adversarial train it - attack it
Can we change the perturbation of a model?
